# LMLML: Library of MultiLingualization for StandardML

LMLML is a library for multi-byte string manipulation.
'LMLML' is an abbreviation of Library of MultiLingualization for ML.

This is **unofficial** repository for LMLML library.

If you get official information, see [LMLML].


## What is this

* LMLML is a library of multilingualization for SML.
* salvaged from the official LMLML distribution (included in SML# 0.90 compiler distribution)


## What is **not** this

* This is not official repository.


## Support platforms

* SML#

    Not supported.
    SML# > 0.90 requires interface file (.smi).

* SML/NJ

    Tested 110.97

* MLton

    Tested 20130715


## SML/NJ

### Install

Compile with `CM`.

```sh
$ LOCAL_LIB=~/.smlnj/lib
$ mkdir -p $LOCAL_LIB
$ echo 'CM.stabilize true "LMLML.cm";' | sml
$ echo "LMLML.cm $LOCAL_LIB/LMLML.cm" >> ~/.smlnj-pathconfig
$ mkdir -p $LOCAL_LIB/LMLML.cm
$ cp -R .cm $LOCAL_LIB/LMLML.cm/.cm
```

Refer to `$/LMLML.cm` from your `sources.cm`.


### Test

Performs unit tests by loading `test/sources.cm`.

```
- CM.make "test/sources.cm";
[autoloading]
.
.
val it = true : bool
- TestMain.test();
............................................F.............................F...F.F..............................
..................................................F.............................F...F.F........................
.
.
```


## MLton

### Install

To install [LMLML] for MLton, use `Makefile.mlton`.

```sh
$ make -f Makefile.mlton install
  [MLTON] typecheck LMLML.mlb
..............................Installation has been completed.
Please add the entry to your mlb path map file:

  LMLML /usr/local/mlton/lib/LMLML

```

This command install this library to `/usr/local/mlton/lib/LMLML` by default.
It is able to change the location with `PREFIX` variable like:

```sh
$ make -f Makefile.mlton PREFIX=~/.sml/mlton install
```

After `make install`, you need to add an entry in a mlb path mapping file:

```sh
$ echo 'LMLML $(PREFIX)/lib/LMLML' >> /path/to/mlb-path-map
```

Refer to `$(LMLML)/LMLML.mlb` from your mlbasis files.


### Test

Perform unit tests for [LMLML], execute `test` target:

```sh
$ make -f Makefile.mlton MLB_PATH_MAP=~/.sml/mlton/mlb-path-map
  [MLTON] typecheck LMLML.mlb
  [MLTON] test/sources
test/sources
..........................................................................F.F..F......................................
...........................................E.............................F.F.EF.......................................
..........................................E.............................F.F.EF........................................
.
.
```

### Example

The `example` target builds `Grep` and `SuffixArray` examples.

- `Grep` (./example/RegExp/example/Grep/sources) is a multilingualized grep.
    `sources <codec> <regex>` read input string from stdin per line, and checking the contents of the line matches to the regexp pattern.
    If the line matches to the pattern, print it.


- `SuffixArray` (./example/SuffixArray/main/sources) is a multilingualized full text search.
    `sources <code> <infile> <pattern>` searches fragments match to the pattern.
